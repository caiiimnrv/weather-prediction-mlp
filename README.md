Title: Implementation of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Algorithm  in Building a Weather Prediction Model

In this study, the researchers have implemented the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network algorithm; a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
to predict the weather type using precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and wind levels.

The researchers have used Python 3.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0 version and Google Colab in coding and executing the machine learning model.
